### Hello Hackers!!!
<hr/>
<p>Here is a piece of advice before you start solving these challenges:
<ul>
<li><b>The most important point: </b>Its completely normal to get stuck and not being able to solve the challenges in one go. Give yourself some time, think harder eventually you'll get it.</li>

<li>Again, if you are not able to solve a challenge don't jump to the solution immediately. <br/><b><i>GIVE YOURSELF TIME!!!</b></i><br/>
After succesfully solving the challenge on your own, do look up for the solutions online. There are plenty of walkthroughs available which you can check to explore different methods with which other people in the community have solved these challenges.<br/>
You will discover a lot of new things using this method.</li>
</ul>
