### Level19-Level20

<hr>
To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.
<hr/>

<b>Solution</b><br/>

<p>
<ol>

<li>The setuid binary file "bandit20-do" has elevated permissions.</li>
<li>If we run it as given in example<br/>
<code>./bandit20-do id</code><br/>
It returned id of both bandit19 and bandit20
</li>

<li>If we try to access the password file of bandit20 from bandit_pass, then we get permission denied error.</li>
<li>But if we execute the command using the setuid file, then we can execute commands as bandit20, thus the file reveals the password for next level.</li>
