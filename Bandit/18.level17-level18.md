<hr>
There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new
<hr/>

<b>Solution</b><br/>

<p>
<ol>

<li>Two files are present "passwords.old" and "passwords.new"</li>
<li>We can use the diff command to check the differences in both files<br/>
<code>diff passwords.old passswords.new</code></li>
<li>We can see that the one line was changed from "w0Yfolrc5bwjS4qw5mq1nnQi6mF03bii" to "kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd
" ("<" denotes old file and ">" denotes new file)</li>
<li>The password for bandit18 is <br/><code>kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd</code> </li>
