### Hello Hackers!!!
<hr/>
<p>Here is a piece of advice before you start solving these challenges:
<ul>
<li><b>First and most important:</b>Its completely normal to get stuck and not being able to solve the challenges in one go. Give yourself some time, think harder eventually you'll get it.</li>

<li>Before solving challenges always read about the commands which are mentioned under the "commands you may need to solve this level" section.<br/>
Don't jump to solve the challenge before you have a good idea about the commands mentioned.</li>
<br/>

<li>Your best resource to study the commands is the man page.<br/>
To know about a command just enter <code>man &lt;command-name&#62;</code></li>
<br/>

<li>Again, if you are not able to solve a challenge don't jump to the solution immediately. <br/><b><i>GIVE YOURSELF TIME!!!</b></i><br/>
After succesfully solving the challenge on your own, do look up for the solutions online. There are plenty of walkthroughs available which you can check to explore different methods with which other people in the community have solved these challenges.<br/>
You will discover a lot of new things using this method.</li>
</ul>

### All The Best and Happy Hacking !!!
