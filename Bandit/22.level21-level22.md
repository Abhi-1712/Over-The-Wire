<br/>
</li>Lets check the script present in the usr/bin/ directory. Script name:cronjob_bandit22.sh</li>
<li>We can see that the password present in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 is directed to a file named "t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv" in the tmp directory.</li>
<li>We don;t have permission to open /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 but we can open /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv.<br/>
<code>cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv</code></li>
