### Level25-Level26

<hr>
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€¦ The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.
<hr/>

<b>Solution</b><br/>

<p>
<ol>

<li>If we try to login to bandit26 using the private key, we log out immediately after a successful login<br/>
<code>ssh bandit26@localhost -i bandit26.sshkey</code></li>
<br/>

<li>In the challenge it is mentioned that the shell for bandit26 is not /bin/bash but something else.<br/>Let's check the shell</li>
<li>In Linux System every user account created is stored in a file "/etc/passwd".Let's check the file for bandit26
<br/><code>cat /etc/passwd</code></li>
<br/>

<li>We can see in the above image that, for bandit26 there is a file instead of shell whixh is /usr/bin/showtext</li>
<li>The /usr/bin/showtext file contains a script.<br/>
export TERM=linux sets terminal emulator to linux.<br/>
And it uses more command to view ~/text.txt file.</li>

<li>Let's use this information to our advantage.<br/>
The more command is used to view large text files in command prompt which displays one screen at a time.<br/>The more command doesn't exit if whole contents of the file is not displayed.<br/>
As the connection to bandit26 was immediately closing after successful login, we can trigger the more command such that it will not close and thus the connection to bandit26 will not exit.</li>

<li>So for more command to not exit we can resize the terminal size such that only 1-2 lines are displayed at an instance and thus the more command will not exit.</li>

<li>Now we are logged in and the more command is triggered.</li>

<li>We can start vim editor by entering v and this will start up an editor at current line.</li>
<li>So to open a file in vim, we can insert<br>
<code> :e /bandit/banndit_pass/bandit26</code></li>
<br/>

<li>This will display the contents of the file and thus the displayed string is password for next level.</li>

<li><i>Don't logout from bandit26 as next level is connected to the previous one.</i></li>
