<b>Solution</b><br/>

<p>
<ol>
<li>We can see this is an uppercase shell.</li>
<li>Whatever commands we enter are converted to uppercase thus leading to errors.</li>

<li>We can use "$0" to invoke a shell. $0 contains the name of shell which is "sh".This is set at shell initialization</li>
<li>We come out of the interactive shell.</li>
<li>If we check the current user using <code>whoami</code> command we see that we are bandit33.This means that the uppershell had elevated previleges.</li>
<li>From knowledge of previous levels we know password is stored in /etc/bandit_pass for correspoding users. As we are currentlt logged in as bandit33 we have permission to open the file.<br/><code>cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33</code></li>
<li>The displayed string is password for bandit33.</li>
