### Level16-Level17

<hr/>
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

<b>Solution</b><br/>

<p>
<ol>

<li>We will use nmap command here to check the open ports</li>
<li>Option "p" is used to specify the range of ports to be scanned</li>
<li>Option "sV" is used to probe alll open ports to determine service/version info<br/>
<code> nmap -sV -p31000-32000 localhost </code></li>
<li>The scan results show that port 31790 is open and speaks SSL</li>
<br/>
<image>

<li>Now connect to port 31790 using openssl s_client<br/>
<code> openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 </code></li>
<br/>
<image>

<li>Once connected enter the password of current level<br/>
<code>Pasword:cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd</code>
</li>
<li>RSA KEY for bandit17 is returned</li>
<br/>
<image>

<li>Store the RSA key in a file</li>
<li>We don't have permission to create files in present working directory but we can create in /tmp/</li>
<li>Creating folder named "b17_passsword" in /tmp/<br/>
<code>mkdir /tmp/b17_password</code>
</li>
<li>Switch to the b17_password directory and create a file named b17.key using vim or any other editor and paste the RSA key</li>
<li>To exit from vim,press escape key and type :wq and hit enter</li>

<li>Now change the permission of the file such that only the user(owner) can read and write, and rempve read permissions from group and other users<br/>
<code>chmod og-r b17.key</code></li>

<li>Now connect to bandit17 using ssh<br/>
<code>ssh -i b17.key bandit17@localhost</code>
</li>

<li>Now you are loggged in as bandit17</li>





</ol>
