### Level6 -> Level7
<hr/>
Password is stored somewhere on the server and has the following properties:<br/>
<ul>
<li>owned by user bandit7</li>
<li>owned by group bandit6</li>
<li>33 bytes in size</li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<b>Solution:</b><br/>
<p>
<ol>

<li>Use the 'find' command:</li>
<code> find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c </code>

<li>In the above command:
    <ul>
    <li>'-user bandit7' checks for the files whose owner is named 'bandit7'</li>
    <li>'-group bandit6' checks for the files which are owned by group named 'bandit6'</li>
    <li>'-size 33c' checks for the files which are 33 bytes in size</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>The output is quite messy.We don't have permission to open most of the files and some directories are missing, this is the reason for the messages such as permission denied and no such file or directory.</li>

<li>Upon careful observation of the output, we can see that password is present in the file named 'bandit7.password' whose path is 'var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password'</li>

<li>To get a cleaner output we can use:</li>
<code>find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null</code><br/>

<li>2>dev>null redirects all errors like "no such file or directory" or "Permission denied" to /dev/null
this will not print the error messages on the terminal</li>

<li>The displayed string is password for bandit7.<br/>
Login using the username bandit7 and the obtained password.</li>
