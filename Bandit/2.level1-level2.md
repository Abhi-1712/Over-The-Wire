### Level1 -> Level2

The password is stored in a file named "-" located in home directory

<b>Solution:</b><br/>

1.Use the 'ls' command to list of content present in the working directory.<br/>

2.Here the command 'cat -' doesn't work because using - as an argument refers to STDIN/STDOUT.<br/>

3.So to display the contents of the file:<br/>

cat ./- or cat < - can be used.<br/>
