<hr>
Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!

<b>Solution</b><br/>

<ol>

<li>Let's  set the shell to /bin/shell<br/>
<code>:set shell=/bin/bash</code></li>
<br/>

<li>In the challenge it is mentioned that required command may be "ls", so lets try it.<br/>
Since we are in subshell we can execute the ls command by entering<br/><code> :!ls</code></li>
<br/>

<li>We can see a executable file bandit27-do, let's try to run it.<br/>
<code>./bandit27-do</code></li>
<br/>

<li>So this is similar to one of the previous levels which we had solved, we can run this file as bandit27 as this has elevated privileges.</li>
<li>Let's print the password from /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27 using this executable as bandit26 doesn't have permission to run.<br/>
<code>:!./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27</code></li>
<br/>

<li>The displayed string is password for next level.</li>
