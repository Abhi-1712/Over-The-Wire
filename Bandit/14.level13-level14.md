### Level13-Level14

<hr/>
The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14.
For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level.
Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.

<ol>

<li>In this level a private key is provided with the help of which we can
